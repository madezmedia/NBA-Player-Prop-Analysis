# Basketball Performance Statistical Analysis

## Overview

This module provides advanced statistical analysis capabilities for basketball performance data, offering comprehensive insights through various statistical techniques.

## Features

- Z-score Calculation
- Independent T-Test
- Percentile Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Confidence Interval Estimation
- Performance Consistency Metrics
- Outlier Detection

## Key Statistical Methods

### 1. Z-Score Calculation
- Standardize performance metrics
- Compare individual performances to group averages
- Identify exceptional performances

### 2. T-Test
- Compare performance between two groups
- Determine statistical significance
- Assess performance differences

### 3. Percentile Analysis
- Calculate key percentile values
- Understand performance distribution
- Identify performance tiers

### 4. Correlation Analysis
- Pearson Correlation
- Spearman Rank Correlation
- Measure relationship between variables

### 5. Confidence Interval
- Estimate performance range
- Provide statistical confidence
- Account for sampling variability

### 6. Performance Consistency
- Calculate mean and standard deviation
- Compute coefficient of variation
- Assess performance stability

### 7. Outlier Detection
- Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
- Z-Score Method
- Identify exceptional or anomalous performances

## Usage Examples

### Z-Score Calculation
```python
from utils.statistical_analysis import BasketballStatisticalAnalyzer

player_points = [25.3, 27.1, 26.8, 24.6, 28.2]
z_score = BasketballStatisticalAnalyzer.calculate_z_score(
    player_points, 
    26.5
)
```

### T-Test Between Players
```python
t_test_result = BasketballStatisticalAnalyzer.perform_t_test(
    lebron_points, 
    curry_points
)
```

### Correlation Analysis
```python
correlation = BasketballStatisticalAnalyzer.correlation_analysis(
    points_per_game, 
    minutes_played
)
```
