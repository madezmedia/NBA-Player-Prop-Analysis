# Basketball Performance API Integration

## Overview

This module provides advanced API integration capabilities for retrieving basketball performance data, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous data retrieval.

## Features

- Synchronous Player Statistics Retrieval
- Asynchronous Multi-Player Statistics Retrieval
- Team Statistics Retrieval
- Error Handling
- Logging
- Data Processing and Standardization

## Key Components

### `BasketballAPIIntegration`
- Fetch player statistics
- Retrieve team performance data
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive logging

## API Sources

- RapidAPI (Basketball-Head API)
- Supports multiple data endpoints

## Usage Examples

### Synchronous Player Stats
```python
from utils.api_integration import BasketballAPIIntegration

api = BasketballAPIIntegration()

# Retrieve player statistics
lebron_stats = api.fetch_player_stats("LeBron James")
```

### Asynchronous Multi-Player Stats
```python
import asyncio
from utils.api_integration import BasketballAPIIntegration

async def get_player_stats():
    api = BasketballAPIIntegration()
    players = ["LeBron James", "Stephen Curry", "Kevin Durant"]
    
    async_stats = await api.fetch_player_stats_async(players)
    return async_stats

# Run async function
player_stats = asyncio.run(get_player_stats())
```

### Team Statistics
```python
team_stats = api.fetch_team_stats("Los Angeles Lakers")
```

## Supported Data Retrieval

### Player Statistics
- Points per Game
- Rebounds per Game
- Assists per Game
- Field Goal Percentage
- Three-Point Percentage
- Advanced Metrics
  - Player Efficiency Rating
  - True Shooting Percentage

### Team Statistics
- Team Performance Metrics
- Aggregate Player Statistics
- Historical Performance Data

## Advanced Features

### Error Handling
- Retry mechanism for failed API calls
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful error management

### Logging
- Detailed API interaction tracking
- Performance and error logging
- Configurable logging levels

### Data Processing
- Standardize API response
- Transform raw data into consistent format
- Handle missing or incomplete data

## Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous data retrieval
- Minimal overhead
- Efficient API call management

## Future Improvements

- Support for more API endpoints
- Enhanced caching mechanisms
- Real-time data streaming
- Additional data sources integration

## Dependencies

- Requests
- AIOHTTP
- AsyncIO
- python-dotenv

## Security Considerations

- Secure API key management
- Environment variable configuration
- Error masking

## Ethical Data Usage

- Respect API usage terms
- Minimize unnecessary API calls
- Protect user privacy
