# Basketball Performance Prediction Models

## Overview

This module provides advanced machine learning capabilities for predicting basketball player performance using sophisticated predictive models.

## Features

- Synthetic data generation
- Multiple model training (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Performance metrics calculation
- Model persistence and loading
- Feature scaling

## Model Types

### Random Forest Regressor
- Ensemble learning method
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Robust to overfitting

### Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Sequential model building
- High predictive accuracy
- Handles complex feature interactions

## Key Components

### `BasketballPerformancePredictor`
- Train machine learning models
- Predict player performance
- Save and load trained models

## Usage Example

```python
from utils.ai_models import BasketballPerformancePredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = BasketballPerformancePredictor()

# Generate synthetic training data
synthetic_data = predictor.generate_synthetic_player_data()

# Train model
metrics = predictor.train_model(synthetic_data)

# Predict performance
player_features = np.array([
    29,      # age
    70,      # games played
    35,      # minutes played
    0.54,    # field goal %
    0.35,    # 3-point %
    0.75,    # free throw %
    7.5,     # rebounds
    7.2      # assists
])

predicted_ppg = predictor.predict_performance(player_features)
```
