# Basketball Performance Model Deployment

## Overview

This module provides advanced model deployment and serving capabilities for basketball performance prediction models, offering comprehensive model management, versioning, and API-based serving.

## Features

- Model Saving and Versioning
- Model Loading
- FastAPI-based Model Serving
- Comprehensive Error Handling
- Logging Integration
- Flexible Deployment Options

## Key Components

### `ModelDeploymentManager`
- Save machine learning models
- Load and manage model versions
- Create model serving applications
- Start model servers

## Usage Examples

### Saving a Model
```python
from utils.model_deployment import ModelDeploymentManager

# Initialize Deployment Manager
deployment_manager = ModelDeploymentManager()

# Save trained model
model_path = deployment_manager.save_model(
    trained_model, 
    "basketball_performance_predictor"
)
```

### Loading a Model
```python
# Load the latest model version
loaded_model = deployment_manager.load_model(
    "basketball_performance_predictor"
)

# Load a specific model version
specific_model = deployment_manager.load_model(
    "basketball_performance_predictor", 
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

### Creating a Model Serving App
```python
# Create a FastAPI app for model serving
app = deployment_manager.create_model_serving_app(
    "basketball_performance_predictor"
)
```

### Starting a Model Server
```python
# Start a model serving server
deployment_manager.start_model_server(
    "basketball_performance_predictor",
    host="0.0.0.0",
    port=8000
)
```

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Model Training**
   - Develop and train machine learning models
   - Validate model performance

2. **Model Saving**
   - Save models with versioning
   - Store model metadata
   - Maintain model registry

3. **Model Serving**
   - Create FastAPI-based serving applications
   - Expose prediction endpoints
   - Handle input validation

4. **Server Deployment**
   - Start model servers
   - Configure host and port
   - Support multiple model versions

## Advanced Features

### Model Versioning
- Timestamp-based versioning
- Metadata tracking
- Easy model retrieval

### FastAPI Integration
- Automatic input validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Swagger documentation

### Prediction Endpoint
- Accept player performance features
- Return predicted points per game
- Provide model version information

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient model loading
- Minimal serialization overhead
- Low-latency prediction serving

## Future Improvements
