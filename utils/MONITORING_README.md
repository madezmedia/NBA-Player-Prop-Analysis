# Basketball Performance Monitoring and Telemetry

## Overview

This module provides advanced system performance monitoring and telemetry capabilities, offering comprehensive insights into application resource utilization and performance characteristics.

## Features

- Real-time System Metrics Tracking
- Continuous Performance Monitoring
- Metrics Export
- Performance Analysis
- Error Tracking
- Sentry Integration

## Key Components

### `PerformanceMonitor`
- Capture system performance metrics
- Start/stop monitoring
- Export performance data
- Analyze resource utilization

## Captured Metrics

### System Performance
- CPU Usage
- Memory Utilization
- Disk Usage
- Network I/O
- Process Memory Consumption

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```python
from utils.monitoring import PerformanceMonitor

# Initialize Performance Monitor
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()

# Start monitoring
monitor.start_monitoring(interval=1.0)

# Perform application tasks
# ...

# Stop monitoring
monitor.stop_monitoring()
```

### Metrics Export
```python
# Export metrics to JSON
metrics_file = monitor.export_metrics(output_format='json')
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
# Analyze captured performance metrics
performance_analysis = monitor.analyze_performance()
```
