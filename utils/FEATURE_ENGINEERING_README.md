# Basketball Performance Feature Engineering

## Overview

This module provides advanced feature engineering capabilities for basketball performance data, transforming raw statistics into meaningful, machine learning-ready features.

## Features

- Feature Extraction
- Data Scaling
- Derived Feature Computation
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Outlier Detection

## Key Components

### `BasketballFeatureEngineer`
- Transform raw player data
- Compute advanced features
- Scale and normalize data
- Analyze feature importance
- Reduce dimensionality
- Detect statistical outliers

## Usage Examples

### Feature Extraction
```python
from utils.feature_engineering import BasketballFeatureEngineer

feature_engineer = BasketballFeatureEngineer()

# Extract features from player data
features = feature_engineer.extract_features(player_data)
```

### Feature Scaling
```python
# Scale features using standard scaling
scaled_features = feature_engineer.scale_features(features)
```

### Feature Importance
```python
# Compute feature importance for points per game
importance = feature_engineer.feature_importance(
    features, 
    target_column='points_per_game'
)
```

### Dimensionality Reduction
```python
# Reduce features to principal components
reduced_features = feature_engineer.dimensionality_reduction(features)
```

## Derived Features

### Scoring Efficiency
- Combines points per game with shooting percentages
- Measures offensive productivity

### Playmaking Score
- Integrates assists with scoring ability
- Captures player's overall offensive contribution

### Versatility Index
- Combines points, rebounds, and assists
- Indicates player's multi-dimensional impact

## Scaling Methods

### Standard Scaling
- Zero mean
- Unit variance
- Preserves original distribution shape

### Min-Max Scaling
- Scales features to [0, 1] range
- Preserves zero values
- Handles non-Gaussian distributions

## Feature Importance

- Mutual Information Regression
- Measures feature relevance to target variable
- Identifies most predictive features

## Dimensionality Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduces feature space
- Captures maximum variance
- Eliminates multicollinearity

## Outlier Detection

### Methods
- Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Z-Score
- Identifies statistically unusual data points

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient feature transformation
- Minimal computational overhead
- Scalable feature engineering

## Future Improvements

- Advanced feature interaction techniques
- More sophisticated feature selection
- Deep learning feature extraction
- Automated feature engineering

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data exposure
- Stateless feature transformations
- Reproducible feature engineering

## Ethical Data Usage

- Transparent feature creation
- Avoid introducing bias
- Interpretable feature engineering
