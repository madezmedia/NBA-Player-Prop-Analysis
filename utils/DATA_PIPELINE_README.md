- Statistical Analysis
- Logging
- Error Handling

## Usage Examples

### Fetch Player Data
```python
from utils.data_pipeline import BasketballDataPipeline

pipeline = BasketballDataPipeline()

# Fetch data for multiple players
players = ["LeBron James", "Stephen Curry", "Kevin Durant"]
player_data = pipeline.fetch_player_data(players)
```

### Player Comparison
```python
# Compare player performances
comparison = pipeline.compare_players(players)
```

### Performance Report
```python
# Generate comprehensive performance report
performance_report = pipeline.generate_performance_report(players)
```

## Data Processing Workflow

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Fetch player data via API
   - Asynchronous multi-player data fetching
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Data Processing**
   - Standardize and enrich player statistics
   - Add advanced statistical analysis
   - Cache processed data

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Calculate Z-scores
   - Compute percentiles
   - Assess performance consistency
   - Detect statistical outliers

4. **Reporting**
   - Generate comprehensive performance reports
   - Export reports in JSON format
   - Timestamp and track report generation
